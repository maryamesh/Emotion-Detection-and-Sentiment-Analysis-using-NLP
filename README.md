# Emotion Detection and Sentiment Analysis using NLP

This project focuses on emotion detection and sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It utilizes the BERT transformer model to accurately identify and classify various emotions from text inputs, enhancing machine understanding of human sentiments.

## Dataset

### Emotions Dataset for NLP

#### About the Dataset

- **Context**: A collection of documents annotated with emotions, useful for NLP classification tasks.
- **Content**: Contains a list of documents with emotion labels. The dataset is divided into training, testing, and validation sets for building machine learning models.

#### Example

- Text: "I feel like I am still looking at a blank canvas, blank pieces of paper."
- Emotion: Sadness

## Code and Documentation

- The full code, along with detailed explanations and outputs, is available in the `main.ipynb` file.
